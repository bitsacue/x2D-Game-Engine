This has got to do with the fact that computer hardware is varied. On slow hardware we need to make sure the time runs equally fast as on fast hardware. This is done by calling the update step more, and the draw step less (hence why you might experience low F\+P\+S on slow hardware). In an ideal scenario, the update step will be called as often as the draw step.
